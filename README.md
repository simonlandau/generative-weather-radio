# Generative Weather Radio
Generative Weather Radio is a web app which uses the OpenWeather API and OpenAI's GPT3.5 and TTS model to generate audio weather reports for any city.

## TODO
- [ ] add more form inputs (voice, language)
- [ ] add error handling for form inputs
- [ ] explore other api endpoints for expanding report (airquality, news, etc.)
- [ ] deploy to Vercel (set up sentry for error tracking?)
- [ ] build custom audio player component?
- [ ] clerk user authentication?
